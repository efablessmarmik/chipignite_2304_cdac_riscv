Make in India RISC-V Initiative with collaboration of CDAC and Vega Processors

Quad 32 bit RISC V based SOC design pin compatible to arduino platform and this soc targeted for efabless Shuttle program. This project uses only open source tool set for simulation,synthesis and backend tools. The SOC flow follow the openlane methodology and SOC environment is compatible with efabless/carvel methodology.
